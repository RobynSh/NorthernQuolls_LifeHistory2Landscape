# Step 1: Record Cleaning 

The R code *Step1_RecordCleaning.R* documents the process of cleaning Atlas of Living Australia and NatureMap records for:
* *D. hallucatus* - for modelling its distribution (input file, *Dh.ALA_NM_Raw.Pilbara.Records.csv*, is found in the Data folder)
* All Critical Weight Range mammals - for generating a survey bias layer (input files, *Mammal.spp_NM_Raw.Records.csv* and *MammalSpecies_Info.csv*, are found in the Data folder)

This code generates the following files (output to the Data folder):
* *Dh_FinalPresenceCoords.csv* - the final cleaned record coordinates, i.e. presences for MaxEnt modelling in step 2.
* *CWR_Bias_Layer.asc* - a bias layer, generated by using a probability function reflecting survey effort. This is used in step 2 for generating background points (pseudo-absences).
* *RasterCorr_Total1km_0.7Only.pdf* - Plot displaying raster correlations (only those with at least one pairwise comparison greater than/less than 0.7/-0.7 are shown).

Prior to this step, we merged ALA and NatureMap data sets and removed unnecessary columns and duplicated records (which left only one ALA record, all of the others were already represented in the NatureMap data base). Records with missing coordinates were filtered out prior to this script. Rasters were also derived/prepared/manipulated prior to this step. For example, all rasters have been aggregated to the same resolution based on the most biologically appropriate metric (mean, median, min, max, etc.), and cropped/masked to the same extent (the Pilbara IBRA region, with some coverage into surrounding regions). For details on raster manipulation/creation see the Supplementary material for the paper (Appendix S2-S3).



# Step 2: Species Distribution Modelling

The R code *Step2_RunMaxEnt.R* steps through the process of:
- Loading in rasters, defining categorical/continuous variables, and splitting them into different sets, i.e. different representations of the same environmental variables (for example, the Principle Components of all Bioclim variables vs. individual Bioclim variables).
- Generating background points  (*Dh_FinalBackgroundCoords.csv*) using the bias layer created in step 1
- Running MaxEnt with the package SDMtune (looping through for each raster set), by first splitting data for training (with cross validation), tuning and testing. Next, we run the default model, drop correlated variables, tune hyperparameters, drop variables with low importance and run the final model using optimised hyperparameters and variables from the previous steps. 
- Throughout MaxEnt modelling, figures/tables are output into the folder SDM_outputs, in the relevant subfolders for each ratser set:
 - Results_Set1
 - Results_Set2
 - Results_Set3
 - Results_Set4
 - Results_Set5
 - Results_Set6
 
  Figures/tables/data outputs: 
  - *Checkerboard.CV.pdf* - plot displaying geographically separated cross validation folds

  - *final_model.AUC.rdata* - The final model R object
  - *FinalModel_MapPredict.AUC_Samps.pdf* - Figure showing the habitat suitability predictions from the final model (with presence locations)
  - *FinalModel_MapPredict.AUC.pdf*  - Figure showing the habitat suitability predictions from the final model (without presence locations)
  - *FinalModel.AUC.ROC.pdf* - ROC Curve for the final model
  - *FinalModel.VarImp.AUC.pdf* - Variable importance bar chart for the final model

  - *Model.CV.varSel.Tune.best.auc.rdata*- R object for the model after correlated variables dropped, with best/tuned hyperparameters
  - *Model.CV.varSel.Tune.Best.RedVar.auc.rdata*- R object for the model after correlated variables dropped, hyperparameter tuning, and low importance variables dropped
  - *OptimizeMod.Results.AUC.csv* - Hyperparameter tuning results saved in table format
  - *Response_AUC_Marg.final.bestCV.pdf* - Marginal response curves for the final model
  - *Response_AUC_Uni.final.bestCV.pdf* - Univariate response curves for the final model
  - *Tuned.CV.VarSel_reduced.ROC.pdf* - ROC Curves for each CV fold for the model after correlated variables dropped, hyperparameters tuned and low importance variables dropped 
  - *Tuned.CV.VarSel.ROC.pdf* - ROC Curves for each CV fold for the model after correlated variables dropped and hyperparameters tuned
